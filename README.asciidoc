image:++./inkscape/linux-because-software-problems-should-not-cost-money--logo.svg[Linux logo]

This is the new and https://inkscape.org/[Inkscape]-based version of
Shlomi Fish’s web graphics logo reading “Linux - Because Software Problems Should Not Cost Money”.

Its homepage is now at *TODO* .

The previous version, which was done using CorelDRAW, can be found on
https://www.shlomifish.org/art/linux_banner/[its page on Shlomi Fish’s site],
but its source CDR, and the available GIF file result may not be too usable.

== HOW TO USE

See the README file in the link:inkscape/[sub-directory]
for more information.
